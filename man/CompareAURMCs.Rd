\arguments{
\item{data}{Data.frame.}

\item{alpha}{Type I error.}

\item{arm_name}{Name of the column containing treatment arm. Coded as 0 for
reference, 1 for treatment.}

\item{censor_after_last}{Introduce censoring after the last event \emph{if} no
observation-terminating event is present.}

\item{idx_name}{Name of column containing a unique subject index.}

\item{int_method}{Integration method, selected from "left", "right", "trapezoid".}

\item{perturbations}{Number of perturbations to use for bootstrap inference.
If \code{NULL}, only analytical inference is performed.}

\item{random_state}{Seed to ensure perturbations are reproducible.}

\item{status_name}{Name of column containing the status. Must be coded as 0
for censoring, 1 for a measurement, 2 for death. Each subject should have
an observation-terminating event, either censoring or death.}

\item{tau}{Truncation time.}

\item{time_name}{Name of column containing the observation time.}

\item{value_name}{Name of the column containing the measurement.}
}
\value{
Data.frame.
